These forms are classified as temporal qualifiers, which provide context about the timing or period when a particular linguistic expression was used. Specifically, the outdated form, obsolete form, and archaic form are all types of temporal qualifiers. The outdated form refers to a word or expression that was once commonly used but has since fallen out of favor. Similarly, the obsolete form is a word or expression that has completely gone out of use. The archaic form, on the other hand, is a word or expression that is no longer used in everyday language but may still be found in historical or literary contexts.

There are several tenses that serve to situate events in time relative to the moment of speaking. Among these, the present, past, and future are commonly recognized as primary tenses. The present tense is used to describe actions or conditions that are currently happening or generally true. The past tense, also known as the preterite in some languages, refers to actions or states that occurred in the past. The future tense is utilized for actions or states that will occur at some point in the future. Additionally, there are more nuanced tenses such as the imperfect, which is used to describe ongoing or repeated actions in the past. Understanding these tenses is crucial for effective communication in any language.</INPUT>\\n    \\n    model\\n    <output>\\n    \\'terms:\\'[\\'tense\\']\\n    \\'types:\\'[]\\n    </output>\\n    <INPUT>In linguistics, certain words or particles are classified based on their properties or behaviors.

Cliticness refers to the property of being a clitic, which is a word or phrase that is grammatically bound to a neighboring word or phrase.

A reflexive frame is a fundamental concept in linguistics that involves a specific syntactic structure. There are several subtypes of reflexive frames, including the reflexive dative transitive frame, reflexive ditransitive frame, reflexive reciprocal frame, reflexive transitive frame, and reflexive transitive pp frame. Each of these subtypes is a type of reflexive frame, sharing certain characteristics with the broader category. The reflexive dative transitive frame, for instance, is a specific type of reflexive frame that involves a dative object. Similarly, the reflexive ditransitive frame involves two objects. The reflexive reciprocal frame implies a reciprocal action between the subject and object. The reflexive transitive frame involves a transitive action, while the reflexive transitive pp frame involves a prepositional phrase. Understanding these different types of reflexive frames is essential for grasping the nuances of linguistic structures.</INPUT>\\n    \\n    model\\n    <output>\\n    \\'terms:\\'[\\'reflexive frame\\', \\'reflexive transitive frame\\', \\'reflexive reciprocal frame\\', \\'reflexive transitive pp frame\\', \\'reflexive ditransitive frame\\', \\'reflexive dative transitive frame\\']\\n    \\'types:\\'[]\\n    </output>\\n    <INPUT>In the realm of linguistic information, adjective frames are categorized into several types.
